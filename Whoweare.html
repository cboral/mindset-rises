  <h2>Session content</h2>

  This course consists of an online-interview, ten online-sessions and a final presentation (given by the client). 
  The interviewer team consists of a psychologist, doctor, scientist and professional job mentor. 
  In the respective sessions, the client has to watch a video or a picture for each session.
  These videos and images were specifically determined using the AI-artifical intelligence and algorithm ​​technique after during and after the interview.
  This is followed by a reflective conversation between the client and the professional team. 
  The duration of the session varies between 60 minutes and 180 minutes. 
  Appointments can be arranged relatively flexibly. 
  However in order to determine added value or profit the sessions must not be less than a week and more than 12 days apart.

  We work with the program Zoom.
